💳 Financial Fraud Detection Model with Dashboard:

📌 Project Overview

The Financial Fraud Detection Model leverages Machine Learning (ML) and Data Analytics to identify suspicious transactions, detect fraudulent activities, and provide real-time insights via an interactive dashboard.
This system is essential for banks, fintech companies, and financial institutions to mitigate risks and prevent financial fraud.


✨ Key Features

1️⃣ Data Acquisition & Preprocessing:

Collect transactional data from:

Banking systems

Payment gateways

Hugging Face datasets (hugging id)

Perform ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) operations

Handle missing values and apply data normalization

Apply feature engineering to capture behavioral patterns & anomalies


2️⃣ Fraud Detection Algorithms:

🔹 Supervised Models

Logistic Regression

Decision Trees & Random Forest

Gradient Boosting (XGBoost, LightGBM)


🔹 Unsupervised Models

Isolation Forest

One-Class SVM

Autoencoders (deep learning anomaly detection)


🔹 Graph-Based Analysis

Detect fraudulent networks and relationships between entities

3️⃣ Real-Time Fraud Monitoring:

Stream transaction data using Apache Kafka / Spark Streaming

Implement alerting system for high-risk transactions

4️⃣ Interactive Dashboard & Reporting:

Real-time fraud visualization with heatmaps, bar charts, anomaly scores

Built with Streamlit.

✅ Expected Deliverables:

📂 Cleaned dataset & preprocessing scripts

🤖 Fraud detection model implementations (supervised, unsupervised, deep learning)

📊 Evaluation metrics (Precision, Recall, F1-Score, AUC)

📉 Interactive fraud detection dashboard

📁 GitHub repository with documentation

🎥 Final presentation or video demo


🎯 Learning Outcomes:

Strong understanding of fraud detection techniques

Hands-on experience with real-world financial transaction data

Ability to implement supervised, unsupervised, and graph-based models

Skills in real-time data streaming & anomaly detection

Dashboard development for fraud monitoring


🔮 Future Enhancements:
